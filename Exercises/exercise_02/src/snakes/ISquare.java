 * This Interface provides the Structure for a Square. The Square is what the Game

 * The ISquare Interface provides Methods for moving the Player onto and away from

 * It also provides some Informations needed by both the Game and the Players.
 * These Informations include its position, whether it is the first or the last square,
 * whether it is occupied and if it is a Wormhole exit or not.
 * <p>
 * The Interface is implemented by the Square class and mostly used by the Game, that
 * consists of several Squares and the Player, that stands on Squares.
