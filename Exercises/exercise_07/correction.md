The prototypes seem reasonable. 
You could think about rotating the board depending on which player's turn it is. So each player sees his home screen.
You could think about hideing the buttons that are unecessary in a turn (i.e. the buttons that correspond to another player)
You could think about giving each Player a name (additionally to a color)
